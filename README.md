This is a simple Diary application built using Python's tkinter library. The app allows users to write daily diary entries, which are automatically saved into a folder named after the current date. Each entry is saved as a text file, with the file name based on the current date and time to ensure uniqueness.
Write Diary Entries: A large text box for entering diary content.
